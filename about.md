I'm a developer who's passionate about writing good code.

I've built several apps using JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, and Ruby on Rails, using Git/Github and deploying Heroku. I have advanced knowledge HTML5 and CSS, and am experienced with SQL and Firebase.

Currently, I'm looking forward to adding my efforts to a team at a company that's as passionate as I am about doing good work.
