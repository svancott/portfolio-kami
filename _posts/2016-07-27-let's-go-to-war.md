title: The Path to Becoming a Developer- Part Two
---
The next step I took in becoming a developer was learning JavaScript. According to Google, JavaScript is “an object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.” That’s exactly what I wanted to do, create interactive effects in the browser, aka give the page the ability to do things. I’ve always been a lover of logic and logic puzzles, so it’s no surprise that I quickly grew fond of JavaScript. I ate up all the information I could on JavaScript functions and raced through [Code School’s](https://www.codeschool.com) courses on the program.

Once I found [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) I was hooked for good. They give you a task, and using your preferred language, in my case JavaScript, you have to make it work by building functions. After completing the tasks, you have access to all the correct answers, which are voted on by ‘best practice’. You can compare how you completed the tasks with the ‘best practice’ answers. It’s a great way to learn and improve your skills. Almost every time I read these top rated answers, I learn something new and can incorporate those ideas/methods in the future. 

I think Codewars is great practice for real world programing. You’re given a task, and told to complete it the best way possible. Instead of just jumping right into the code, a smart way to go about this is to map out in your mind (or on paper) the steps needed to answer the problem. Once you have the steps mapped out, then you can knock them all out in order. Without doing this critical process, it’s easy to get stuck in the middle of the task and be lost on what to do next.

The harder the tasks are to complete, the more knowledge you need to complete them. One of the most helpful sites I’ve found is [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/), the self proclaimed “World’s Largest Web Development Site”. The have detailed tutorials on many programming languages, including a huge section on JavaScript. What I used the most was their examples of JavaScript’s [string](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp) and [array](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp) methods. Most of these methods are essential to knowing how to write powerful functions. I highly recommend bookmarking them and referring to them frequently.

Another one of the most useful tools I found in my path to becoming a developer is [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). It’s a community of over six million programmers helping each other by posting their questions and having them answered by other programmers. The best answers are voted on, with the best answers showing first. Chances are if you are stuck on something in your code, someone else has been their before. With a simple search you can find a question that someone had just like yours, and see the answers of other (more experienced) programmers. And it’s great not just for JavaScript, but any sort of programming in general.

Now that I had JavaScript under my belt, it was time to build some real apps! In my next post I’ll talk about building my very first app!
