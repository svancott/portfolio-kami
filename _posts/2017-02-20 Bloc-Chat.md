title: Bloc Chat
short-description: Bloc Chat is real-time chat application built with AngularJS and Firebase.
---
After building my Bloc Jams (link) app using AngularJS, I decided I wanted to build another app using the framework, and decided on *Bloc Chat*. It’s a real time chat application that uses Firebase and Angular.

Firebase is a mobile platform designed to help develop high-quality apps. I used it to store the database for *Bloc Chat* and found it very useful. Once I got the hang of the $firebaseArray service, it was easy to pull data off the database to display it dynamically. I used UI Bootstrap to create the app’s modals. UI Bootstrap and its many components are a great help in developing apps with Angular. Lastly, to make and store the user’s screen name, I used ngCookies and the $cookies service, which make it easy to store information in the browser for future use.

I hit a few roadblocks while making *Bloc Chat* and did quite a bit of research while trying to get unstuck. One of the main issues I had was displaying each chat rooms’ messages individually when the name of the room was clicked. According to Firebase, it’s good practice to keep your data structures as flat as possible, meaning don’t nest your data too deeply. Although for my purposes, nesting all the data would have been *much* easier, I decided I wanted to follow their advice and keep my data nice and flat. I made separate paths for the rooms and messages, but now had to figure out how to connect the two. How could I get the messages from a certain room to display while being stored in a completely separate path? 

To resolve the issue I turned to $state params. In index.html, I display the list of available rooms by using an ngRepeat. My ‘RoomCtrl’ controllers has a Room service injet which gets the data from the ‘rooms’ path on firebase. Each room name in the list of rooms displays as link with an <a> tag, and so I added a ui-sref for each link that inserts that room’s unique room ID (created by Firebase) to the url when that room is clicked. 

```javascript
	<div ng-repeat="room in roomData.rooms">
		<a ui-sref="home({roomId: room.$id})">
			{{room.name}}
		</a>
	</div>
```
In my app.js, I use the $stateProvider service to format my ‘home’ state.



```javascript
$stateProvider
.state('home', {
url: '/rooms/:roomId',
controller: 'CurrentRoomCtrl as $currentRoom',
templateUrl: '/templates/home.html'
});

```
So let’s say that you are on the landing page of *Bloc Chat*. The list of available rooms is automatically displayed using the data from our firebase database. If you click on ‘Steve’s Room’, the ‘home’ template will display in the view. In our $stateProvider service we made the url for the ‘home’ state to include the roomID. We can now use that roomID to call the $firebaseArray service, but this time on thSe ‘messages’ path. We can now make the roomId a method in our messages controller by pulling it from $state.params, and then put that into the AngularFire’s child() method. It looks like this:

```javascript
this.roomId = $state.params.roomId;
this.getMessagesByRoomId = $firebaseArray(firebase.database().ref("messages").child(this.roomId));
```
And there you have it, each room displaying it own messages. Easier said than done :)

With this project, I also tried to keep my files organized as well as possible. Although it’s just a simple app for now with a relatively small number of scripts, I know it’s good practice to keep them all in order, so I have separate directories for my templates, controllers and services.

I had a lot of fun building *Bloc Chat* and learned a lot along the way. I enjoyed using Firebase as a database and would definitely recommend it. I am continually impressed by the power and versatility of the AngularJS framework. The more I code and practice building apps, the more I want to learn! With the right tools, anything is possible!
