title: Life in Brazil
---
Brazil! I', I'm living here with my wife and our two kids and slowly but surely getting ready to move back to the States. Seven years earlier I met my wife-to-be in the US, and two years after that we decided to move down here to Brazil so I could get to know her family and culture as well. In total, I’ve been here over five years now! It’s a great country and I’ve had an awesome time here, but now it’s time to move back home.

I’ve been practicing and improving my programming skills for a while now and have been loving it. The more I learn, the more I enjoy it. I relate it to my 3 year old riding his bike. We got him his first bike for Christmas last year when he was a little over 2. He loved even the sight of it and was clearly excited, but the only thing he could really do was push it around. When we sat him on it and tried to get him pedaling, he just didn’t have the leg strength and coordination to get it going. He would pedal half a rotation every once in awhile and be thrilled. As he practiced, we could see him making progress and enjoying it more. Now he’s at a stage where he can race around the house, cut corners, and even go backwards! The better he got at riding his bike, the more excited he was about it and the more he wanted to ride!

That’s just the way I feel about programming. When I first started I knew nothing. I was a complete novice. I first started where everyone (in my opinion) should start, with the backbone of the internet, HTML. I learned how to build a static web page. I downloaded [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), a free open source text editor that allows you to preview the page you’re building in the browser. I thought it was great (and still do actually :)). In no time at all I was able to create my very own web pages, although very bland. The next step was to spice them up with CSS (cascading style sheets).

I started learning about CSS and how to style my own pages. With Brackets, you can see all the CSS changes you are making in real time. There is an amazing amount of ways you can style a page, and can even use CSS transitions to make your page come alive. Although styling the pages was great, I had more passion about actually creating pages that making them pretty.

Now that I could create pages and styles them, it was time for me to move forward and learn how to make them actually do things!

In my next post I’ll talk about a few other things I did along the way... hint ...**JavaScript**
