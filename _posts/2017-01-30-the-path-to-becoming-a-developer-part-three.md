title: The Path to Becoming a Developer- Part Three
---
Now that I had HTML, CSS and JavaScript under my belt, it was time to make a real-world, working app. Being a big fan of Spotify, I decided to make a similar app of my own called **_Bloc Jams_**. You can read about the process more in depth [here](). I first built the app’s pages with HTML and CSS, and added some functionality to it with CSS transitions and JavaScript. Once I had the app designed aesthetically to my liking, I had to figure out how to make it play music, its main function! So I turned to [Buzz!](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/), a small but powerful JavaScript audio library that uses the HTML5 audio element. I found it easy to use and employed several of its built-in methods in the app.

About the same time that I was trying to incorporate Buzz!, I started learning jQuery. For those who don’t know, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a JavaScript library with loads of functions already written for you to integrate in your app. By using jQuery, I cut the amount of code I had to write in half!

Although no one can disagree that using jQuery reduces the amount of code you have to write in an app, there are several schools of thought that discourage its use. As far as its actual functionality is concerned, the main disadvantage is that it increases the page loading time for the user. Since it is such a large library, loading all the necessary code can cause delays. 

Being a **JavaScript** library, all of jQuery’s code is written in JavaScript, and the functions in the library can be written individually and as needed in the app itself, foregoing the library and only writing the code you need (although sometimes time-consuming). But the benefit of using pure JavaScript yourself is that you learn along the way. The problem with using jQuery is that many programmers (or potential programmers) use the library’s functions, barely knowing their capability, and having now idea how to actually write the original function in JavaScript. 

It’s a tough decision. Should you use jQuery and speed up your production at the cost of learning? Or should stick with pure JavaScript and strengthen your understanding of the language? If I had to choose a side, I’d stick with the latter. Learning deeply is something that’s important to me, and I find it satisfying. Down the road, a more knowledgeable version of myself can use jQuery once it understands the code behind it.

After putting the finishing touches on **_Bloc Jams_** I became interested in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). For those who aren’t familiar with it, it’s a JavaScript framework mainly used to build SPAs (single page applications). Basically, a user can navigate through your app at their disposal without ever having to load a new page. This is possible by using a model view that’s updated using templates. When a user clicks on a link within the app, that template is triggered and enters the view, with relatively zero load time. 

I think AngularJS is pretty much awesome, although I struggled with it at first. There is quite a lot to learn about the framework, and hadn’t seen many of its components anywhere before. Things like controllers, factories, and services were completely new to me. After working hard at it for a while, I started getting the hang of it, and loved it! Keeping your code nice and organized is  simple by putting each kind of script in its own section. I encourage anyone interested in building a single page application to give Angular a shot. I wrote more about **_Bloc Jams_** and Angular [here](). If you wanna hear about another app I built with Angular, check out [**_Bloc Chat_**]().

And that sums it up til now, my path to becoming a developer, which is by no means complete. My next step is learning [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/)! I’m pumped about it, and will be sure to post once I’ve got my hands dirty in it. 

Thanks for reading and _keep coding_!
